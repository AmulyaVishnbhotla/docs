= FAQs

Below are frequently asked questions (FAQs) specific to CS50x AP 2018. For questions specific to edX, see https://support.edx.org/[support.edx.org].

== Can I re-submit problem sets?

We currently are not accepting submissions. Check back on 1 September 2018 for more information. Once submissions do open, you may re-submit problems as many times as you would like before 30 April 2019 and your most recent submission is what will be graded.

== Does CS50 AP have deadlines?

Only one, when the course itself ends! You are welcome to take CS50 AP at your own pace, so long as you submit all problems no later than 30 April 2019.

== Does CS50 AP have office hours?

No, afraid CS50 AP is too large! However, office hours are available to students taking CS50 through Harvard College or Harvard Extension School.

== Does CS50 AP have quizzes?

No, only students taking CS50 AP through their own high school would have quizzes depending on their particular teacher.

== Does CS50 AP offer CS50 Certificates?

Yes; students who complete all the problems with a 60% or higher are eligible for a certificate.

== How can I hide CS50's Facebook Group from my newsfeed?

If you joined CS50's https://www.facebook.com/groups/cs50/[Facebook Group] but don't want to see new posts in your newsfeed, hover over image:menu.png[screenshot] in the top-right corner of any of the group's posts in your newsfeed, then select *Unfollow CS50* from that menu, per the below. You'll still be in the group, so you can still visit it at https://www.facebook.com/groups/cs50 anytime you'd like. *Note that old posts won't disappear from your newsfeed (unless you select *I
don't want to see this* for each of them), but new posts will no longer appear. CS50 will thus gradually disappear from your newsfeed as other posts appear.*

== How can I play videos faster or slower?

If using Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (i.e., a browser that supports HTML5 and MP4), you _should_ see a *SPEED* control below each video, per the below. If not, your browser might not support different speeds, in which case you can download the video (as via the blue links beneath it) and use a client-side player like http://www.videolan.org/vlc/[VLC], whose *Playback* menu should allow you to alter playback speed. Beware, though, David talks fast at 1x, let alone 2x!

== How can I turn off notifications from CS50's Facebook Group?

If you joined CS50's https://www.facebook.com/groups/cs50/[Facebook Group] but don't want to receive notifications about it, simply visit https://www.facebook.com/groups/cs50/, click *Notifications* at top-right, and then select *Off*, per the below. You'll still be in the group, so you can still visit it at https://www.facebook.com/groups/cs50 anytime you'd like.

== Is it too late to start CS50 AP?

Nope, even if this is your first time here, you're not too late to begin! You are welcome to take CS50 AP at your own pace, starting whenever you'd like, so long as you finish before 30 April 2019.

== What does edX's Verified Certificate of Achievement look like?

Odds are 2018's will resemble https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/theme/example-certificate-verified.png[this sample].

== What if YouTube is blocked in my country?

Even though edX's video player relies on YouTube, all of CS50 AP’s videos are downloadable multiple resolutions (240p, 360p, 720p, 1080p, and sometimes 4K). Under any (blocked) video, look for blue links like the below, which will allow you to download videos from CS50 AP’s servers.
