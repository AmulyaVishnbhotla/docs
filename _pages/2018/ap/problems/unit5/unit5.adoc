== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along three axes primarily.

Correctness::
  To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?

Design::
  To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

Style::
  To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.

== Getting Ready

Beyond introducing you to web programming, the overarching goal of this problem is to empower you to teach yourself new languages so that you can stand on your own at the end of the year. We'll guide you through each, but if you nonetheless find yourself Googling and asking lots of questions of classmates and staff, rest assured you're doing it right!

First consider joining Daven for a tour of HTML.

And consider reviewing some of David's examples. There are a lot of videos here, so don't feel like you have to watch them all if you are comfortable with the topics they cover!

Next consider joining Joseph again for a tour of CSS, the language with which web pages can be stylized.

Got it all? Not to worry if not, you'll have plenty of time to look back and review! For now, on to the problem.

== Getting Started

Up until this point in the course, you've been compiling just about all of your assignments in the terminal of CS50 IDE and running programs from there to see if they work. Now that we're diving into the land of web programming with HTML and CSS, however, you'll need to check the correctness of your program not by compiling, but rather by starting up CS50 IDE's web server. 

First, we'll need to create a new directory to house our HTML and CSS files as with:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir ~/workspace/unit5
----

To serve your website, you'll right click on your `unit5` directory and select `serve`.
You'll have a newly created webpage... containing nothing (for now). Ultimately, assuming you haven't put any other content in `~/workspace/unit5`, you should see something like the below.

== Hello, HTML

Finally, you should be ready to go! Your assignment is simply to create a web page. You should have one HTML file (named whatever you'd like, it does not need to be `index.html`) containing the web page's structure, and one CSS file for styling. Other than that, there are no restrictions on other things you'd like to include.

Feel free to be creative with this assignment. Make something that is meaningful to you - it could be a blog post, a pseudo-shopping website, or a family tree. The sky is the limit! At the bare minimum, your page *MUST* include the following:

* A table
* A link to an external website
* A button (which needn't actually have a function, but should exist on the page)
* At least two divs, with div IDs
* A list
* A heading
* A paragraph
* At least three images, either externally linked or contained within your `~/workspace/unit5` directory
* At least one block of text that is not left-aligned
* At least two different fonts
* At least three different colors of text
* At least two other extra features, one in HTML and one in CSS

Of course, you can do many more of each of the above; and to make a neat website, you'll have to!

Because this assignment will result in something different for each person, there's no `check50` for this one. Make sure that you've included everything listed above and you have no broken links or permission issues and you should be good to go.

== How to Submit
