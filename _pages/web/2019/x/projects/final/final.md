# Final Project

## Objectives

* Gain experience with designing and implementing a web application with
  Python and JavaScript.

## Overview

The final project is your opportunity to design and implement a dynamic website
of your own. So long as your final project draws upon this course's lessons,
the nature of your website will be entirely up to you, albeit subject to the
staff's approval.

## Requirements

In this project, you are asked to build a web application of your own. The
nature of the application is up to you, subject to a few requirements:

* Your web application must be sufficiently distinct from the other projects in
  this course, and more complex than those.
* Your web application must utilize at least two of Python, JavaScript, and
  SQL.
* Your web application must be mobile-responsive.
* In `README.md`, include a short writeup describing your project, what's
  contained in each file you created or modified, and (optionally) any other
  additional information the staff should know about your project.
* If you've added any Python packages that need to be installed in order to run
  your web application, be sure to add them to `requirements.txt`!

Beyond these requirements, the design, look, and feel of the website are up to
you!
