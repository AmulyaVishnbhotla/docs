= Problem: Mario

== tl;dr

Implement a program that prints out a half-pyramid of a specified height, per the below.

[source, subs="macros,quotes"]
----
$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#5#
    pass:[#]
   pass:[##]
  pass:[###]
 pass:[####]
pass:[#####]

$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#3#
  pass:[#]
 pass:[##]
pass:[###]

== Background

Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend a "half-pyramid" of blocks before leaping (if he wants to maximize his score) toward a flag pole. Below is a screenshot.

== Specification

* Write, in a file called `mario.c` in your `~/chapter1/mario/` directory, a program that recreates a similar half-pyramid using hashes (`#`) for blocks.
* To make things more interesting, first prompt the user for the half-pyramid's height, a non-negative integer no greater than `8`.
* If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than `8`, you should re-prompt for the same again.
* Then, generate (with the help of `printf` and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid.
* Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window.

== Usage

Your program should behave per the example below. Assumed that the underlined text is what some user has typed.

[source,subs="macros,quotes"]
----
$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#4#
   pass:[#]
  pass:[##]
 pass:[###]
pass:[####]
----

[source,subs="macros,quotes"]
----
$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#0#
----

[source,subs="macros,quotes"]
----
$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#-5#
Height: [underline]#4#
   pass:[#]
  pass:[##]
 pass:[###]
pass:[####]
----

[source,subs="macros,quotes"]
----
$ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#-5#
Height: [underline]#five#
Retry: [underline]#40#
Height: [underline]#24#
Height: [underline]#4#
   pass:[#]
  pass:[##]
 pass:[###]
pass:[####]

=== Style

== Staff Solution

If you'd like to play with the staff's own implementation of `mario`, you may execute the below.

[source]
----
~cs50/chapter1/mario/less
----

== Hints

Try to establish a relationship between (a) the height the user would like the pyramid to be, (b) what row is currently being printed, and (c) how many spaces and how many hashes are in that row. Once you establish the formula, you can translate that to C!

== How to Submit

=== Step 1 of 2

Ensure that `mario.c` is in `~/chapter1/mario`, as with:

[source]
----
cd ~/chapter1/mario
ls
----

If `mario.c` is not in `~/chapter1/mario`, move it into that directory, as via `mv` (or via CS50 IDE's lefthand file browser).

=== Step 2 of 2

* To submit `mario`, execute
+
[source]
----
cd ~/chapter1/mario
submit50 cs50/problems/2019/ap/mario/less
----
+
inputting your GitHub username and GitHub password as prompted.

If you run into any trouble, email sysadmins@cs50.harvard.edu!

You may resubmit any problem as many times as you'd like before the deadline.

Your submission should be graded for correctness within 2 minutes, at which point your score will appear at https://submit.cs50.io/[submit.cs50.io]

This was Mario.
