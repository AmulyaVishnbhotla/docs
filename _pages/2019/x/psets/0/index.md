# Problem Set 0

## What to Do

1. Download and install the latest version of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), if you don't have it already.
1. Implement your very own Scratch project using Chrome, per [this specification](scratch.md).

## Advice

Here's how to try out David's examples from lecture:

1. Download [one or more of them](https://cdn.cs50.net/2018/fall/lectures/0/src0/) or a ZIP of [all of them](https://cdn.cs50.net/2018/fall/lectures/0/src0.zip), which you should then unzip.
1. Visit [beta.scratch.mit.edu](https://beta.scratch.mit.edu/), click **Try It**, select **File > Upload from your computer**, and select the `.sb3` file that you'd like to try out.

## Project 5050

If you'd like to learn a bit more about others who've come before you, take a look at http://project5050.org/[Project 5050] by CS50's own Hailey James '19 et al.

## Hello, World

Suffice it to say it's a bit harder to meet classmates when taking a course online. But, thanks to technology, everyone can at least say hello!

If you have a phone (or digital camera) and would like to say hello to classmates, record a 1- to 2-minute video of yourself saying hello, perhaps stating    where in the world you are, why you're taking CS50x, and something interesting about you! Try to begin your video by saying "hello, world" and end it with    "my name is ...., and this is CS50." But, ultimately, it's totally up to you.

If you do record a video, upload it to YouTube (unless blocked in your country, in which case you’re welcome to upload it elsewhere) so that you can provide  us with its URL when you submit!

## How to Submit

### Step 1 of 2

Submit [this form](https://forms.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/0).

CS50 collects some start-of-semester data for planning purposes via Problem Set 0’s form, so expect the form to take 15 minutes or so. Subsequent problem sets' forms will be much shorter!

### Step 2 of 2

This step assumes that you've downloaded your [Scratch](scratch.md) project as a file whose name ends in `.sb3`. And this step also assumes that you've [signed up for a GitHub account](https://github.com/join), per the above form.

1. Visit [cs50.me](https://cs50.me/), log in with your GitHub account, and click **Authorize submit50**.
1. You should receive two emails from GitHub inviting you to join CS50's "organizations" on GitHub. Click the button in those emails to accept both of the invitations.
1. Go to `https://github.com/submit50/USERNAME`, replacing `USERNAME` in the URL with your own GitHub username.
1. On the left side of the screen, click on **Branch: master**.
1. In the field that says **Find or create a branch...**, copy and paste precisely this value, `cs50/2019/x/scratch`, then click **Create branch**. That value is just a unique identifier for this problem.
1. Click the button that says **Upload files**.
1. Drag your `.sb3` file into the box that says **Drag files here**.
1. Click the green **Commit changes** button.

That's it! If you visit [cs50.me](https://cs50.me/) again, you should see your submission. If you click on the **check50** link next to the submission, you should see (after a minute or two) whether your project met all of the requirements. You are welcome to resubmit as many times as you'd like (before the deadline)!

If you don't see any results on [cs50.me](https://cs50.me/), make sure that your branch is named `cs50/2019/x/scratch`. If you mistyped it the first time, you should create a new branch (repeating steps 5 and 6), making sure to name it `cs50/2019/x/scratch`!
