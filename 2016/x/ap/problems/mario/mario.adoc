== Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along four axes primarily.

Scope::
 To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?
Correctness::
 To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?
Design::
 To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?
Style::
 To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To obtain a passing grade in this course, all students must ordinarily submit all assigned problems unless granted an exception in writing by the instructor.


== Itsa Mario

Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend a "half-pyramid" of blocks before leaping (if he wants to maximize his score) toward a flag pole. Below is a screenshot.

image:pyramid.png[Super Mario Brothers]

Write, in a file called `mario.c` in your `~/workspace/chapter1` directory, a program that recreates this half-pyramid using hashes (`#`) for blocks. However, to make things more interesting, first prompt the user for the half-pyramid's height, a non-negative integer no greater than `23`. (The height of the half-pyramid pictured above happens to be `8`.) If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than `23`, you should re-prompt for the same again. Then, generate (with the help of `printf` and one or more loops) the desired half-pyramid. Take care to align the bottom-left corner of your half-pyramid with the left-hand edge of your terminal window, as in the sample output below, wherein underlined text represents some user's input.

[source,subs="macros,quotes"]
----
~/workspace/chapter1 $ [underline]#./mario#
height: [underline]#8#
       pass:[##]
      pass:[###]
     pass:[####]
    pass:[#####]
   pass:[######]
  pass:[#######]
 pass:[########]
pass:[#########]
----

Note that the rightmost two columns of blocks must be of the same height. No need to generate the pipe, clouds, numbers, text, or Mario himself.

By contrast, if the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than `23`, your program's output should instead resemble the below, wherein underlined text again represents some user's input. (Recall that `GetInt` will handle some, but not all, re-prompting for you.)

[source,subs=quotes]
----
~/workspace/chapter1 $ [underline]#./mario#
Height: [underline]#-2#
Height: [underline]#-1#
Height: [underline]#foo#
Retry: [underline]#bar#
Retry: [underline]#1#

To compile your program, remember that you can execute

[source,bash]
----
make mario
----

or, more manually,

[source,bash]
----
clang -o mario mario.c -lcs50
----

after which you can run your program with the below.

[source,bash]
----
./mario
----

If you'd like to check the correctness of your program with `check50`, you may execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
check50 1617.chapter1.mario mario.c
----

And if you'd like to play with the staff's own implementation of mario, you may execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
~cs50/chapter1/mario
----

Not sure where to begin? Not to worry. A walkthrough awaits!

== How to Submit

=== Step 1 of 3

Recall that, in the Scratch problem, you signed up for a https://github.com/[GitHub account].

If you haven't already, visit https://cs50.me/[cs50.me], log in with that same GitHub account, and click *Authorize application*. If you've forgotten your GitHub account's password, https://github.com/password_reset[reset it] first.

Once you've logged in and authorized, you can immediately log out. Logging in once simply ensures that you can submit code via `submit50`, per step 2 of 3!

=== Step 2 of 3

* To submit `mario`, execute
+
[source]
----
cd ~/workspace/chapter1/
submit50 2016/ap/mario
----
+
inputting your GitHub username and GitHub password as prompted.

If you run into any trouble, email sysadmins@cs50.harvard.edu!

You may resubmit any problem as many times as you'd like.

=== Step 3 of 3

Submit https://forms.cs50.net/2016/x/ap/mario[this form]!

Your submission should be graded within a few weeks, at which point your score will appear at https://cs50.me/[cs50.me]!

This was Mario.
