==  Getting Started

To start, open a terminal window and execute

[source,bash]
----
update50
----

to make sure your workspace is up-to-date.

Next, navigate to your `~/workspace/chapter4` directory.  For the first time in a while, no big code distro this time, but there is one important file to download. Execute

[source,bash]
----
wget http://docs.cs50.net/2016/ap/problems/recover/recover.zip
----

This file's somewhat large (about 16 MB), so it may require some time to download depending on the speed of your internet connection! Then unzip that ZIP file, delete it, and the navigate into your newly-created `recover` directory. If you list the contents of your directory, you should find two files therein:

[source,bash]
----
camera.raw  recover.c
----

You'll be doing all your work for this problem inside of this `recover.c` file. Open it up and... darn, it's totally empty!

Alright, now let's put all your new skills to the test.

In anticipation of this problem, David spent several days snapping photos of people he knows, all of which were saved by his digital camera as JPEGs on a 1GB CompactFlash (CF) card. Unfortunately, he's not very good with computers, and somehow deleted them all!  Thankfully, in the computer world, "deleted" tends not to mean "deleted" so much as "forgotten."  His computer insists that the CF card is now blank, but he's pretty sure it's lying to him.

Write in `~/workspace/chapter4/recover/recover.c` a program that recovers these photos.

Ummm.

image::adele.jpg[Adele]

Okay, here's the thing.  Even though JPEGs are more complicated than BMPs, JPEGs have "signatures," patterns of bytes that can distinguish them from other file formats. Specifically, the first three bytes of JPEGs are

[source,bash]
----
0xff 0xd8 0xff
----

from first byte to third byte, left to right. The fourth byte, meanwhile, is either `0xe0`, `0xe1`, `0xe2`, `0xe3`, `0xe4`, `0xe5`, `0xe6`, `0xe7`, `0xe8`, `0xe8`, `0xe9`, `0xea`, `0xeb`, `0xec`, `0xed`, `0xee`, of `0xef`. Put another way, the fourth byte's first four bits are `1110`.

Odds are, if you find this pattern of four bytes on a disk known to store photos (e.g., David's CF card), they demark the start of a JPEG.  (To be sure, you might encounter these patterns on some disk purely by chance, so data recovery isn't an exact science.)

Fortunately, digital cameras tend to store photographs contiguously on CF cards, whereby each photo is stored immediately after the previously taken photo.  Accordingly, the start of a JPEG usually demarks the end of another.  However, digital cameras generally initialize CF cards with a FAT file system whose "block size" is 512 bytes (B).  The implication is that these cameras only write to those cards in units of 512 B.  A photo that's 1 MB (i.e., 1,048,576 B) thus takes up 1048576 รท 512 = 2048 "blocks" on a CF card.  But so does a photo that's, say, one byte smaller (i.e., 1,048,575 B)!  The wasted space on disk is called "slack space."  Forensic investigators often look at slack space for remnants of suspicious data.

The implication of all these details is that you, the investigator, can probably write a program that iterates over a copy of David's CF card, looking for JPEGs' signatures.  Each time you find a signature, you can open a new file for writing and start filling that file with bytes from his CF card, closing that file only once you encounter another signature.  Moreover, rather than read his CF card's bytes one at a time, you can read 512 of them at a time into a buffer for efficiency's sake.  Thanks to FAT, you can trust that JPEGs' signatures will be "block-aligned."  That is, you need only look for those signatures in a block's first four bytes.

Realize, of course, that JPEGs can span contiguous blocks.  Otherwise, no JPEG could be larger than 512 B.  But the last byte of a JPEG might not fall at the very end of a block.  Recall the possibility of slack space.  But not to worry.  Because this CF card was brand-new when he started snapping photos, odds are it'd been "zeroed" (i.e., filled with 0s) by the manufacturer, in which case any slack space will be filled with 0s.  It's okay if those trailing 0s end up in the JPEGs you recover; they should still be viewable.

David, of course, only has one CF card, so he's gone ahead and created a "forensic image" of the card, storing its contents, byte after byte, in the file `camera.raw`. which lives inside of `~cs50/chapter4`.  So that you don't waste time iterating over millions of 0s unnecessarily, he's only imaged the first few megabytes of the CF card.  But you should ultimately find that the image contains 50 JPEGs (but don't hardcode that number in, lest we also need to use your program to recover a different set of images off of a different CF card).  You can, then, open the file programmatically with `fopen`, as in the below.

[source,c]
----
FILE* file = fopen("camera.raw", "r");
----

But let's make the program a little bit more flexible. `recover` should accept either zero command line arguments (in which case, you should open the hard-coded `camera.raw` file, as indicated above), or a single command line argument (in which case, you should open the user-provided file, which you may assume is formatted in exactly the same manner as `camera.raw`, albeit with different JPEGs).

When executed, though, your program should recover every one of the JPEGs from the file being examined, storing each as a separate file in your current working directory.  Your program should number the files it outputs by naming each `pass:[###].jpg`, where `pass:[###]` is three-digit decimal number from `000` on up.  (Befriend `sprintf`.)  You need not try to recover the JPEGs' original names.  To check whether the JPEGs your program spit out are correct, simply double-click and take a look!  If each photo appears intact, your operation was likely a success!

Odds are, though, the JPEGs that the first draft of your code spits out won't be correct.  (If you open them up and don't see anything, they're probably not correct!)  Execute the command below to delete all JPEGs in your current working directory.

[source,bash]
----
rm *.jpg
----

If you'd rather not be prompted to confirm each deletion, execute the command below instead.

[source,bash]
----
rm -f *.jpg
----

Just remember to be careful with that `-f` switch, as it "forces" deletion without prompting you.

If you'd like to check the correctness of your program with `check50`, you may execute the below.

[source,bash]
----
check50 1617.chapter4.recover recover.c
----

Lest it spoil your (forensic) fun, the staff's solution to `recover` is not available.

As before, if you happen to use `malloc`, be sure to use `free` so as not to leak memory. Try using `valgrind` to check for any leaks!

== Sanity Checks

Before you consider this problem set done, best to ask yourself these questions and then go back and improve your code as needed!  Do not consider the below an exhaustive list of expectations, though, just some helpful reminders. To be clear, consider the questions below rhetorical. No need to answer them in writing, since all of your answers should be "yes!"

* Does `recover` accept either 0 or 1 command-line arguments? If 0, is `recover` opening `camera.raw`? If 1, is `recover` opening whatever file was passed in as the argument?
* Does `recover` output 50 JPEGs when not passed in any command-line arguments?  Are all 50 viewable?
* Does `recover` name the JPEGs `pass:[###].jpg`, where `pass:[###]` is a three-digit number from `000` through `049`?
* Are you sure that `recover` doesn't have any memory leaks?
