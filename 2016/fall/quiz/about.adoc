= About Quiz

Released at noon on Tue 11/15 and due by noon on Thu 11/17 is a take-home quiz that will cover Weeks 0 through 10 (and Problem Sets 0 through 8), with emphasis on Week 6 (and Problem Set 6) onward. The quiz is open-book: you may use any and all non-human resources during the quiz, but the only humans to whom you may turn for help or from whom you may receive help are the courseâ€™s heads.

The quiz will be released via the course's website and will be submitted via `submit50`. You should expect to spend several (but not 48!) hours on the quiz.

The teaching fellows will hold a course-wide review session for the quiz on Mon 11/14 from 1:00pm until 2:30pm in Sanders Theatre; it will be streamed live at https://live.cs50.net/[live.cs50.net] and be available on demand immediately afterward at https://cs50.harvard.edu/[cs50.harvard.edu]. Sections will not meet on Mon 11/14, Tue 11/15, or Wed 11/16, but office hours on Mon 11/14 will offer additional opportunities for Q&A.

The quiz's format will be similar to the test's format, with short-answer questions as well as longer-answer questions. Some questions may involve code (for which you're welcome to use CS50 IDE).
