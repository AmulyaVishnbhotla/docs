<div class="paragraph">
<p>Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This course ordinarily meets in Sanders Theatre on Mondays and Wednesdays from 1pm until 2pm, but students may simultaneously enroll in another course that meets at the same time. To do so, enroll in the other course via <a href="http://my.harvard.edu/">my.harvard.edu</a>, and then email <a href="mailto:enrollment@fas.harvard.edu">enrollment@fas.harvard.edu</a> to have CS50 added to your study card as well. Undergraduates, GSAS students, and cross-registered students may take CS50 either Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (SAT/UNS) or for a letter grade. When taken for a letter grade, CS50 meets the General Education requirement for undergraduates for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning.</p>

<p>All students, whether taking the course SAT/UNS or for a letter grade, must ordinarily submit all nine problem sets, take both quizzes, and submit a final project in order to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course&#8217;s heads.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Final grades are determined using the following weights:</p>

</table>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Problem sets and the final project are evaluated primarily along axes of scope, correctness, design, and style, with scores ordinarily determined by scope × (3 × correctness + 2 × design + 1 × style). Scores are normalized across teaching fellows at term&#8217;s end, so mid-semester comparisons among students of scores are not reliable indicators of standing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although you must submit all nine problem sets, your lowest score among those problem sets on which you received perfect scores for the axis of scope will be dropped when final grades are determined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Know that CS50 draws quite the spectrum of students, including "those less comfortable," "those more comfortable," and those somewhere in between. However, what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you, in Week 12, end up relative to yourself in Week 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The course is not graded on a curve. The course does not have pre-determined cutoffs for final grades. Those less comfortable and somewhere in between are not at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those more comfortable. Each student&#8217;s final grade is individually determined at term&#8217;s end after input from the teaching fellows. Remarkable effort and upward trending are considered.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nine problem sets are assigned during the semester. Each is due by noon on a Thursday. However, you have nine "late days" that you may "spend" during the semester, each of which provides you with an extension of twenty-four hours. <strong>You may spend no more than one late day on any particular problem set.</strong> You need not inform the staff of your use of a late day; usage of late days is tracked automatically. Lateness of electronic submissions is determined down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven minutes late is equivalent to submitting twenty-four hours late. Late work is not ordinarily accepted once you have exhausted your late days, except in cases of medical emergency. These late days cannot be spent on the course&#8217;s final project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to accommodate students with different backgrounds, some problem sets are released in two editions: a standard edition intended for most students and a "Hacker Edition" intended for some students. Both editions essentially cover the same material. But the Hacker Edition typically presents that material from a more technical angle and poses more sophisticated questions. Hacker Editions are graded separately from standard editions, but those students who submit the former do not receive any form of extra credit outright. When determining grades at term&#8217;s end, however, we do bear in mind submissions of Hacker Editions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be clear, we encourage most students (including aspiring computer scientists) to tackle the standard editions. However, you may choose, week to week, which edition to submit. You may not submit both or some amalgam of the two.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although you must submit all nine problem sets, your lowest score among those problem sets on which you received a perfect score for the axis of scope will be dropped when final grades are determined.</p>

<h2 id="final-project"><a class="link" href="#final-project">Final Project</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this course&#8217;s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to the staff&#8217;s approval. You may implement your project in any language(s) as long as the staff approves. You are welcome to utilize any infrastructure, provided the staff ultimately has access to any hardware and software that your project requires. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact campus, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inasmuch as software development is rarely a one-person effort, you are allowed an opportunity to collaborate with one or two classmates for this final project. Needless to say, it is expected that every student in any such group contribute equally to the design and implementation of that group&#8217;s project. Moreover, it is expected that the scope of a two- or three-person group&#8217;s project be, respectively, twice or thrice that of a typical one-person project. A one-person project, mind you, should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course&#8217;s problem sets. Although no more than three students may design and implement a given project, you are welcome to solicit advice from others, so long as you respect the course&#8217;s policy on academic honesty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Extensions on the final project are not ordinarily granted, except in cases of medical emergency. Technical difficulties are not considered emergencies. Problem sets' late days cannot be spent on the final project. Lateness of submissions is determined down to the minute by submissions' timestamps. Submitting more than seven minutes late is equivalent to not submitting at all.</p>

<h2 id="academic-honesty"><a class="link" href="#academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This course&#8217;s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course&#8217;s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy&#8217;s other constraints. Collaboration on quizzes is not permitted at all. Collaboration on the course&#8217;s final project is permitted to the extent prescribed by its specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course&#8217;s heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly. If the course refers some matter for disciplinary action and the outcome is punitive, the course reserves the right to impose local sanctions on top of that outcome that may include an unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted or for the course itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you commit some act that is not reasonable but bring it to the attention of the course&#8217;s heads within 72 hours, the course may impose local sanctions that may include an unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted, but the course will not refer the matter for further disciplinary action except in cases of repeated acts.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Harvard plans to record audio, photos, and video of Computer Science 50 (CS50) lectures, sections, office hours, seminars, and other events and activities related to CS50 (the "Recordings"), with the aims of making the content of the course more widely available and contributing to public understanding of innovative learning (the "Projects"). The Recordings, or edited versions of them, may be made available to other Harvard students, to students at other educational institutions, and to the broader public via edX, the Internet, television, theatrical distribution, digital media, or other means. It is also possible that the Recordings may be used to make other derivative works in the future. Students may elect not to appear in photos and video used in the Projects and may still participate fully in CS50.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you submit Problem Set 0, you will need to sign online an Acknowledgement and Authorization in the following form:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I understand that, if I do not wish any photos or video of me to be used as part of the Projects, I should so inform the course&#8217;s instructor by emailing <a href="mailto:recordings@cs50.harvard.edu">recordings@cs50.harvard.edu</a> within one week of enrolling in CS50. In that event, I understand that I should sit in the designated "no-film" zone of CS50 classrooms and should not walk in the field of view of the cameras. I understand that Harvard will take reasonable steps, with my cooperation, to avoid including identifiable images of me in the Projects' photos and video shot in classrooms and other course locations after I opt out as just described. I understand that I am free to opt out of the Projects' photos and video in this way, and that doing so will not affect my grade or my ability to participate in course activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless I opt out of the Projects' photos and video as described above and take the steps that will be outlined by the instructor to avoid being filmed, I authorize Harvard and its designees to record and use photos and video of my participation in CS50 and activities related to CS50 (the "Recordings"). I understand and agree that the Recordings may include my image, name, and voice. I also understand and agree that, even if I opt out of the Projects' photos and video, my spoken name and voice may be picked up by microphones outside the "no-film" zone and may be included in the Recordings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I understand and agree that Harvard and its designees will have the irrevocable, worldwide right to make, edit, modify, copy, publish, transmit, distribute, sell, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise use and make available its respective Recordings and any other works that may be derived from those Recordings, in any manner or medium now known or later invented, and to authorize others to do so as well. I hereby transfer to Harvard any rights, including copyrights, I may have in the Recordings that Harvard makes. I will remain free to use and disseminate any ideas, remarks, or other material that I may contribute to course discussions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I acknowledge and agree that I will not be entitled to any payment, now or in the future, in connection with the Recordings or any works derived from them. This Acknowledgment and Authorization is a binding agreement, and is signed as a document under seal governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

<p><strong>Unless you opt out as described in the Acknowledgment and Authorization, you are agreeing, by attending CS50, that your participation in CS50 and related activities may be recorded and used by Harvard in connection with the Projects without further obligation or liability to you, even if you do not sign any authorization.</strong></p>
