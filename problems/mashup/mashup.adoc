= Mashup

== tl;dr
 
Implement a website that lets users search for articles atop a map, a la the below.

== Background

== Distribution

=== Downloading

[source]
----
$ wget https://github.com/cs50/problems/archive/mashup.zip
$ unzip mashup.zip
$ rm mashup.zip
$ mv problems-mashup mashup
$ cd mashup
$ ls
application.py  mashup.db         static/
helpers.py      requirements.txt  templates/
----

=== Running

. Install this problem's dependencies (within `mashup/`):
+
[source]
----
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
----
. Start Flask's built-in web server (within `mashup/`):
+
[source]
----
flask run
----
+
Select *CS50 IDE > Web Server* to see the distribution code in action. You won't be able to search for news, though, just yet!
. In another terminal window, start phpLiteAdmin (within `mashup/`):
+
[source]
----
phpliteadmin mashup.db
----
+
And open the URL that `phpliteadmin` outputs in a new tab. No tables yet! Here on out, if you'd prefer a command line, you're welcome to use `sqlite3` instead of phpLiteAdmin.

== Testing

No `check50` for this one, but be sure to try to "break" your own site, as by

* searching for cities that don't exist,
* clicking markers for cities that don't have any articles,
* dragging and zooming in and out to update your map's markers, and
* searching with potentially dangerous characters like `'` and `;`.

== Staff's Solution

You're welcome to stylize your own app differently, but here's what the staff's solution looks like!

http://pset8.cs50.net/

It is *reasonable* to look at the staff's HTML and CSS. It is *not reasonable* to look at the staff's JavaScript.
